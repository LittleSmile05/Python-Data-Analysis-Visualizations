# Python-Data-Analysis-Visualizations

## Overview:
This Python script is designed to load data regarding programming language posts from a CSV file and visualize it using advanced techniques for enhanced readability. It utilizes the Pandas library for data manipulation, Matplotlib for basic plotting, and Seaborn for improved visualization aesthetics.

## Instructions:
1. **Setup Environment:**
   - Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
   - Install necessary libraries using pip:
     ```
     pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
     ```

2. **Data Preparation:**
   - Place your CSV file containing data on programming language posts in the specified file path.

3. **Running the Script:**
   - Update the `file_path` variable in the script with the path to your CSV file.
   - Execute the script in a Python environment.

4. **Viewing Visualization:**
   - Once the script is executed, it will generate an advanced plot showcasing the trends of various programming languages over time.
   - The x-axis represents the timeline, and the y-axis shows the number of posts.
   - Each programming language is distinguished by a unique color for clarity.

## Files:
- **main.py**: Python script containing functions to load, preprocess, and visualize data.
- **QueryResults.csv**: Sample CSV file containing data on programming language posts.

## Dependencies:
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
